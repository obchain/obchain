## Experiences

### Blockchain
- Designed and optimized AMM (Automated Market Maker), demonstrating a deep understanding of liquidity pools, trading algorithms, and DEX dynamics.
- Developed permissionless Perpetual DEXs with AMMs facilitating settlement of positions for buyers and sellers.
- Enhanced Perpetual DEXs encompassing perpetual contracts, funding rates, and swaps.
- Worked on the Lending & Borrowing design that is heavily influenced by the concentrated liquidity mechanism of Uniswap V3, enabling more efficient capital utilization.
- Worked on arbitrage across Uniswap.
- Optimized betting algorithms, reducing computation time by 40%, resulting in a more efficient and seamless experience for users.
- Worked closely with Energi Core (EVM chain) and other protocols to ensure scalability and security across the blockchain network.
- Oracles: TWAP, Pyth, Binance, Chainlink, Red Stone.
- Deployed cross-chain governance systems using Layer-0 interoperability protocols.
- Chains worked on: Binance, Polygon, Ethereum, opBNB, and Arbitrum.
- Designed and implemented staking contracts, allowing users to earn rewards on platform tokens, boosting token value and fostering increased user participation.

### Frontend
- Developed responsive and interactive blockchain web applications using React.js.
- Integrated frontend with Ethereum blockchain using ethers.js for interacting with smart contracts.
- Created user-friendly interfaces for decentralized applications (dApps) focusing on DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces.
- Implemented blockchain-related features such as wallet connection, transaction monitoring, and contract interactions.
- Utilized Web3.js to enable communication between frontend applications and the Ethereum blockchain.
- Implemented routing and state management using React Router and Redux for scalable and maintainable applications.
- Optimized performance for Dapps, ensuring smooth user experiences even under high transaction loads.
